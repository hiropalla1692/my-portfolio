#3 Things I thought after watching _Marriage Story_

One day I randomly found a noble female face on my computer screen. _Scarlett Johansson_ with her hair short. In her latest film _Marriage Story_ filmed by Netflix. What made this film instantly attractive to me is not only her appearance(I don’t know why but I’ve got a certain impression that the shorter her hair is, the greater the film get) but also my simple curiosity of how films directed by Netflix are like. Here are pieces of what I thought.

### It does not matter what company film but what the story really is

As I said above, a part of what I got interested in about this film is the difference between movies created by Netflix and by traditional film production companies. Let me get straight to the point, there is not any big differences between them from the point of view of audience. What I felt after watching this film is totally the same as the past great films; A great story development that got drawn me in and a bitter aftertaste that I was immersed in. Many people working in movie industry would be surprised and shocked at the change if this film, Netflix film, won the Oscar Award in 2020, but I as an audience don’t care of it at all because I’m pretty sure that the value of 120 minutes will never change.

### the performance of Scarlett Johansson is impeccable

What Scarlett Johansson did in this film makes me feel deeply ashamed that I do not have accurate words that describe it. It’s **INCREDIBLE**. I do not know the detailed technics of acting, but i think she perfectly performed a woman who has trouble in keeping the relationship with her husband. The tone of her voice and the moving on her eyes tells a lot and gives me the real atmosphere of bitter aspects of marriage life. I can not help but expect her to choose her role which can fully show her ability of not physical expression but mental in future. 


### Deep insight into feelings

This film make me realize that every film I get moved by has great insight about life we are apt to miss. When I finished watching this film, what first came to my mind was that the great insight into feelings of people which made the story super real. The subtle transitions of emotions the couple(_Scarlett Johansson_ and _Adam Driver_) performed was so spontaneous that I could almost forget this was fiction story. [The scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Sc-7ioGQs) where they finally strongly exchange words is definitely the highlight. The anger feelings led them say out loud not only what they did want to say and never say so far but what they did not want to say just to blame each other. It might gives us something introspective because I think it is deeply connected with our real life and also implicitly teaches us we humans are not logical, not perfect and thus interesting.

Finally I would like to end this review with some favorite lines they screamed during their fight.

> _You always made me aware of what I was doing wrong, how I was falling short._   - Charlie

> _I can't believe I have to know you FOREVER._   - Nicole

> _Life with you was JOYLESS._    - Charlie

> _You're so merged with your own selfishness that you don't even identify it as selfishness anymore._   - Nicole


Thanks.
